# Functions
---

Functions can take any number of parameters and return a result.
Functions are written as follows:
```
fn function_name(arg1 :: type, arg2 :: type, ...) -> ret_type {
   ...
}
```
where the return type can be omitted if it is `Void`
(an enum with no fields and one variant, this language's unit type).
